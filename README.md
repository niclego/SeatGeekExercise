# SeatGeekExercise
SeatGeekExercise project for Fetch Rewards

Hello,

Please download the project and build. 
You should not need to set anything up to get the Swift Package working. 
I decided to use SDWebImage for the images in the project.

## Technologies Used
User Defaults
TableView
SDWebImage
URLSession
Storyboards

Best,
Nick
